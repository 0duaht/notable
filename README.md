# Notable

Notable tracks notable requests and backgrounds and stores them in your database.  What makes a request or job notable?  There are a number of default situations, but ultimately you decide what interests you.

By default, Notable tracks:

- errors
- 404s
- slow requests and jobs
- timeouts
- validation failures
- CSRF failures
- unpermitted parameters
- blocked and throttled requests

Notable requests are associated with a user whenever possible, making it great for helping customers.  You can also store custom notes.
